## Description: 
I created a responsive portfolio with HTML & CSS. 

## Technologies Used: 
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)

## Installation: 
Using Bootstrap, I installed a navbar with links to other html pages (i.e. portfolio, contact) into my webpage. I created three icons with links to: a PDF file of my current resume, Github page, and LinkedIn page. I also displayed my contact info (email address & phone number) using HTML tables. Lastly, I included two assignments and one project that I have completed so far throughout the course that I am taking.
